micro-engine for simpler AND faster page queries

NOTE! this works in all browser supported by this extension
      since its using querySelectorAll() method
NOTE! here error checks are *minimal*, and there are no exceptions whatsoever.
NOTE! this caches the results and thus works ONLY if you do not 
      add or remove or change nodes you have been searching for. 
      if you have done this, then use Q.FLUSH() ... see bellow
      Which makes it ideal for CHROME extensions
